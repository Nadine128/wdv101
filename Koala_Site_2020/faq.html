    <h4>What does a Koala bear look like?</h4>
    <details>
        <p>Koalas have soft, wool-like fur that is gray above and white below. Their fur is mostly white on the
            underside
            below the neck, and their ears have long white hairs on the tips. The koala resembles a bear, but is
            actually a
            marsupial, a special kind of mammal which carries its young in a pouch.
