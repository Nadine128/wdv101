        <p>
            The Koala Bear National Information Center (KBNIC) is the principal non-profit, non-government organization
            dedicated to the conservation and effective management of the wild koala and its habitat.
        </p>

        <p>
            The KBNIC was formed in 2006. Since our founding the KBNIC has grown from a small group of people interested
            in
            researching koala disease, to a well-known, global organization with a strong track record in strategic
            koala
            research, conservation and community education with a huge focus on mapping -- our absolute strength.
        </p>

            Koalas are disappearing. Loss of koala habitat and koala food trees (eucalyptus leaves) is the leading koala
            threat. Our cuddly koalas are loved around the world. Often called a koala bear, they are actually
            marsupials
            not koala
            bears. Please help koalas by supporting the Australian Koala Foundation.
